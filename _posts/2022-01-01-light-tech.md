As some of you may know, I've been on a sabbatical for the past ~2 years. Among other things, this gave me perspective to think about my relationship with tech. I had most often used the mental model of "how can I use all these amazing tools to enhance my life and work", but I now shifted to something more like "how can I prevent tech from driving me nuts". 

Techniques:
- disable all notifications
- chrome tab groups
- ublock for tailoring the web
- archive all for messaging

Personal changes:
- take your time to respond or react
- snooze emails agressively
 - snooze even before reading if inbox is too crazy today
- stop apologizing for responding late

suggested by gpt3:
-Turn off notifications for social media and email
-Set specific times to check email and social media
-Designate chunks of time for specific tasks, such as 30 minutes for email and 30 minutes for social media
-Use a timer to stay on track
-Take breaks often, even if it's just for a few minutes
-Disconnect from the internet altogether for periods of time
